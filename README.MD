# ADDING SAAS FEATURE IN DOTNET CORE APPLICATION

## Introduction
Welcome to the project repository! This project implements multitenancy to optimize resource usage, simplify maintenance, and enhance scalability. By consolidating hosting resources and enabling centralized monitoring and logging, we ensure efficient and secure management of multiple tenants. This repository contains the source code and documentation for the application, including high-level flow, benefits, challenges, and their mitigations.

## High-Level Flow
Request Handling
Our application is designed to handle incoming requests by identifying the tenant based on the client-specific host name. This enables precise configuration and resource allocation for each tenant.

## Loading Tenant Configuration Data
The application initially stores tenant configuration data as a JSON file within the application. For enhanced scalability and security, we are configuring this to be pulled dynamically from Azure Blob Storage.

## Response Handling
When a host name is recognized, the application retrieves the tenant-specific database connection and establishes it. If no corresponding host name is found in the configuration file, our middleware gracefully handles the TenantNotFound exception.

## Benefits
Implementing multitenancy provides several benefits:

- Resource Optimization: Consolidates hosting resources, allowing for more efficient use.
- Scalability: Enables the application to scale more effectively.
- Simplified Deployment and Maintenance: A single codebase supports multiple tenants, streamlining deployment and maintenance processes.
- Centralized Monitoring and Logging: Using tools like Serilog with Seq or the ELK stack, we achieve centralized monitoring and logging.
- Reduced Operational Costs: As the number of tenants grows, the operational costs decrease significantly, optimizing overall expenditure.

## Challenges and Mitigations
While multitenancy introduces certain challenges, we have strategies in place to mitigate them:

- Security: Strict data isolation and robust security mechanisms prevent data leakage between tenants.
- Performance: Continuous monitoring and optimization ensure the application handles multiple tenants efficiently. Centralized logging and monitoring facilitate this process.
- Complexity: Post-implementation, we address the added complexity in the codebase and configuration management to maintain a streamlined operation.

## Conclusion
By implementing multitenancy, we aim to optimize resource usage, simplify maintenance, enhance scalability, and ultimately deliver a more efficient and cost-effective application.
